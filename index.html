        <h2>Why Algorithms Get Taste Wrong</h2>

        <p>
            Most recommendation systems rely on the same simple idea:
            “People who liked A also liked B — so you will too.”
        </p>

        <p>
            Sounds tidy. But human taste doesn’t behave tidily.
            Two people can watch the same film and walk away with completely opposite reactions.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>One falls for the atmosphere.</li>
            <li>Another can’t stand the main character.</li>
            <li>A third is ready to scream because the pacing feels painfully slow.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            On the surface, the film is identical.
            Inside — each person grabs onto something different.
        </p>

        <p>
            An algorithm that only sees metadata and crowd behavior
            can’t catch these nuances. It predicts patterns, not meaning.
        </p>

        <h3>So what makes this project any different?</h3>

        <p>
            Instead of guessing what you “should” like,
            we start with what you actually felt.
            Your reactions — your words — your story.
