17 Nov – CSS styling

## 1. Purpose of the Website

This website is presented as a promotional example for a fictional recommendation service. 
Its purpose is to demonstrate how people experience the same film differently and to briefly point out the limitations of existing recommendation algorithms.

The project is not a real service — it is simply a theme chosen to support the HTML and CSS requirements of the assignment.

## 2. Target Audience

The target audience includes film lovers who enjoy sharing their impressions and emotional reactions to movies. 
It also targets people who want film recommendations that feel personal and tailored to their individual taste, rather than generic algorithm-based suggestions.

## 3. Planned Pages

### **index.html**
- Short introduction to the topic
- Brief explanation of why viewers react differently to the same film
- Small unordered list with examples 
- Navigation links to other pages
- Purpose: simple entry point and clear structure

### **page2.html**
- Longer text section  
- Unordered list  
- Data table showing different reactions to one film  
- Image gallery with captions  
- Ordered list of user actions
- Purpose: demonstrate more complex HTML elements and structured content

### **page3.html**
- Feedback form
- Email, number, and date inputs  
- Radio buttons and a checkbox  
- Textarea for descriptions  
- radio buttons  
- Submit button  
- textarea  
- submit button
- Purpose: to understand the user a bit better and encourage them to start a conversation.

## 4. Design Decisions

I chose a light grey background and dark grey text to keep the website readable and simple. 
A single accent colour (#4a6fa5) is used for headings, buttons, and hover effects to create a consistent visual theme. 
The layout is centered with a fixed max-width to make the text easy to read, and flexbox is used for the navigation and image gallery. 
For typography I used a clean sans-serif font (Arial/Helvetica) with a 16px base size and increased line spacing for better readability.

## 5. Navigation Structure

All three pages share the same header and navigation:

- Home  
- How It Works  
- Share Your Feelings  

This makes it easy to move between pages and keeps the design consistent.

## 7. Tools Used

- PyCharm
- Chrome developer tools for checking layout
- Git and GitHub for version control  

## 8. Short Discussion of HTML and CSS Evolution

HTML started with simple text markup and later added semantic tags such as header, section, and nav.
CSS was introduced to separate presentation from structure, and CSS3 added properties like flexbox.
In this project I used these basic modern features to create a cleaner layout.

## 9. Important HTML Tags Used

1. **header** – contains the title and navigation.  
2. **nav** – holds the menu links.  
3. **section** – separates content into readable blocks.  
4. **table** – displays structured data (emotional reactions to a film).

## 10. Important CSS Properties Used

1. **display: flex** – used for navigation and the image gallery layout.
2. **font-family / font-size** – create clean, readable typography.
3. **color / background-color** – provide a simple and consistent color scheme. 
4. **margin / padding** – create spacing and improve the visual structure.
