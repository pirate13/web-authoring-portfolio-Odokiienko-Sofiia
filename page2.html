        <h2>Can your taste really be reduced to a tag?</h2>

        <p>
            Do you really think your taste can be reduced to a genre, a release year, or a favorite actor?
        </p>
        <p>
            Maybe to a plot summary. Maybe to a tidy set of tags. But you know better — it can’t.
        </p>
        <p>
            No algorithm understands the real reasons why a film leaves you shattered, thrilled, annoyed, or quietly changed.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Not the moment that broke you.</li>
            <li>Not the tiny detail that gave you hope.</li>
            <li>Not the character who felt like looking in a mirror —</li>
            <li>or the one who made your blood boil the second they appeared.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Only you know what hit you, healed you, or stayed with you long after the credits rolled.
        </p>
        <p>
            You’re not a data point.
        </p>
        <p>
            And we’re not pretending we can decode you through metadata.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can’t feed you into an algorithm and expect it to spit out your soul.
        </p>
        <p>
            That’s not how taste works.<br>
            That’s not how <em>you</em> work.
        </p>
        <p>
            But we can talk. We can listen. We can learn from <strong>your words</strong>, not from statistics about “people like you.”
        </p>
        <p>
            We want to be the kind of companion who understands that you don’t love a “trashy” romance because you’re naive —
            but because something in it echoed a fear, a longing, a memory you’ve carried quietly for years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your taste lives in what moved you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not in a tag.<br>
            Not in a category.<br>
            In you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tell us what you felt.<br>
            And we’ll build your cinematic world around that — not around a formula.

        <h3>How people really react to the same film</h3>
        <p>
            Even when movies share the same labels on the surface, people experience them from completely different emotional angles.
            The same film can feel liberating, disgusting, empty, or deeply human, depending on who is watching.
        </p>
