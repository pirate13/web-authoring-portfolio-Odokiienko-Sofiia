# Behind the Taste – Portfolio Website

This portfolio website is a three-page project created for the Web Authoring module. 
Its purpose is to show that I can build a small, well-structured website using HTML5 and CSS3.

The site is themed as a simple promotional example for a fictional film-recommendation service. 
Each page includes different elements required for the assignment, such as navigation, text sections, lists, a table, images, and a form.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate the main HTML and CSS features we learned in class, while keeping the design clean, readable, and consistent.

## Files in This Project

- page2.html – “How It Works” page
